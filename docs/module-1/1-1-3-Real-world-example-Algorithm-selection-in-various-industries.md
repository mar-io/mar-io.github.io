### 1.1.3 Real-world example: Algorithm selection in various industries

Algorithm selection plays a crucial role in various industries, as choosing the right algorithm can optimize processes, improve efficiency, and save resources. In this section, we will discuss a real-world example from the logistics industry where algorithm selection can have a significant impact.

Consider a package delivery company that needs to find the shortest route to deliver packages to multiple destinations. This problem is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is an NP-hard problem. A brute-force approach to solving the TSP would involve computing all possible routes and selecting the shortest one. However, this method becomes impractical as the number of destinations increases.

An alternative approach is to use a heuristic algorithm, such as the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA). The NNA starts at an initial location, selects the nearest unvisited destination, and repeats the process until all destinations are visited. Although the NNA does not guarantee the optimal solution, it provides a good approximation and is much more efficient than the brute-force approach.

Here's a simple example in Java that demonstrates the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class NearestNeighbor {
    static class Location {
        String name;
        int x, y;

        Location(String name, int x, int y) {
            this.name = name;
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Location> locations = Arrays.asList(
                new Location("A", 1, 1),
                new Location("B", 3, 3),
                new Location("C", 6, 4),
                new Location("D", 8, 1),
                new Location("E", 4, 7)
        );

        List<Location> route = nearestNeighbor(locations);
        route.forEach(location -> System.out.print(location.name + " -> "));
    }

    public static List<Location> nearestNeighbor(List<Location> locations) {
        List<Location> unvisited = new ArrayList<>(locations);
        List<Location> route = new ArrayList<>();
        Location current = unvisited.remove(0);
        route.add(current);

        while (!unvisited.isEmpty()) {
            Location nearest = findNearest(current, unvisited);
            unvisited.remove(nearest);
            route.add(nearest);
            current = nearest;
        }

        return route;
    }

    private static Location findNearest(Location current, List<Location> locations) {
        Location nearest = null;
        double minDistance = Double.MAX_VALUE;

        for (Location location : locations) {
            double distance = distance(current, location);
            if (distance < minDistance) {
                minDistance = distance;
                nearest = location;
            }
        }

        return nearest;
    }

    private static double distance(Location a, Location b) {
        int dx = a.x - b.x;
        int dy = a.y - b.y;
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Location` class to represent a delivery destination. We then implement the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm in the `nearestNeighbor` method, which returns an approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. The `findNearest` method is used to find the nearest unvisited destination. Lastly, the `distance` method calculates the Euclidean distance between two locations.

Choosing the right algorithm for a given problem can lead to significant improvements in efficiency and resource utilization in various industries, such as logistics, finance, and healthcare.
