# Module 1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
## Section 1.3: Complexity Classes

In this section, we will introduce the concept of complexity classes. Complexity classes help us categorize problems based on their inherent difficulty, which is important for understanding the limits of our algorithms and the efficiency of their solutions.

We'll explore the following key concepts:

- P: Problems that can be solved in polynomial time
- NP: Problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time
- NP-Complete: The hardest problems in NP, to which any other NP problem can be reduced in polynomial time
- NP-Hard: Problems at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP

Throughout this section, we will provide practical examples to illustrate these concepts. To give you an idea of how time complexity can be demonstrated using Java code, consider the following example:

```java
public class BigONotationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

        // O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Element at index " + i + ": " + array[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a simple for loop that iterates through an array and prints each element. The time complexity of this code is O(n), which is an example of polynomial time (P class). Stay tuned for a deeper understanding of complexity classes and their implications in the field of computer science.
