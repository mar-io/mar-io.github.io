## 1.2.2: Best, average, and worst-case complexities

When analyzing algorithms, it is important to consider the best, average, and worst-case scenarios. These scenarios help us understand the performance of an algorithm under different conditions.

### Best-case complexity

The best-case complexity represents the minimum number of steps an algorithm takes to complete a task. This scenario usually occurs when the input data is already in an ideal state. In Big O notation, the best-case complexity is denoted as O(Best(n)), where Best(n) is a function that represents the number of steps in the best-case scenario.

### Average-case complexity

The average-case complexity represents the expected number of steps an algorithm takes to complete a task, considering all possible inputs. This scenario is the most useful when comparing different algorithms, as it provides a more realistic view of the algorithm's performance. In Big O notation, the average-case complexity is denoted as O(Avg(n)), where Avg(n) is a function that represents the number of steps in the average-case scenario.

### Worst-case complexity

The worst-case complexity represents the maximum number of steps an algorithm takes to complete a task. This scenario usually occurs when the input data is in the least favorable state. In Big O notation, the worst-case complexity is denoted as O(Worst(n)), where Worst(n) is a function that represents the number of steps in the worst-case scenario.

### Java Example

Let's look at an example in Java that demonstrates the best, average, and worst-case complexities using linear search.

```java
public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // The target is found at index i
        }
    }
    return -1; // The target is not found in the array
}
```

In this example, we're searching for a target value in an array using linear search. Let's analyze the best, average, and worst-case complexities:

1. **Best-case complexity**: The target value is the first element in the array. In this case, the algorithm takes 1 step to complete. So, the best-case complexity is O(1).
2. **Average-case complexity**: On average, the target value is located at the middle of the array. In this case, the algorithm takes n/2 steps to complete. So, the average-case complexity is O(n/2), which can be simplified to O(n) because we ignore constant factors in Big O notation.
3. **Worst-case complexity**: The target value is the last element in the array, or not present at all. In this case, the algorithm takes n steps to complete. So, the worst-case complexity is O(n).

### Conclusion

Understanding the best, average, and worst-case complexities of an algorithm is crucial when designing and selecting algorithms for various tasks. By analyzing these complexities, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm is most suitable for a particular problem and estimate its performance under different conditions.
