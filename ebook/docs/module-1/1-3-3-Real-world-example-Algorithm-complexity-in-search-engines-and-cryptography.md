#### 1.3.3: Real-world example: Algorithm complexity in search engines and cryptography

In this section, we will explore the real-world implications of algorithm complexity in search engines and cryptography. Understanding the complexity of algorithms used in these domains is critical, as it directly affects the performance and security of systems.

**Search Engines**

Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo! process a vast amount of data and millions of search queries every day. To return relevant results quickly, search engines use complex algorithms that consider various factors, such as keyword frequency, page quality, and user behavior.

A popular algorithm used by search engines is the PageRank algorithm, which assigns a rank to each page based on the number and quality of incoming links. The algorithm is iterative and converges to a steady-state solution, representing the importance of each page.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class PageRankExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[][] linkMatrix = {
            {0, 0.5, 0.5, 0},
            {0, 0, 1, 0},
            {1, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 0, 1, 0}
        };
        double[] pageRanks = computePageRanks(linkMatrix);
        System.out.println("Page ranks: " + Arrays.toString(pageRanks));
    }

    public static double[] computePageRanks(double[][] linkMatrix) {
        int n = linkMatrix.length;
        double[] pageRanks = new double[n];
        double[] prevPageRanks = new double[n];
        double dampingFactor = 0.85;
        double epsilon = 1e-6;

        Arrays.fill(pageRanks, 1.0 / n);

        do {
            System.arraycopy(pageRanks, 0, prevPageRanks, 0, n);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                double sum = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    sum += linkMatrix[j][i] * prevPageRanks[j];
                }
                pageRanks[i] = (1 - dampingFactor) / n + dampingFactor * sum;
            }
        } while (!converged(pageRanks, prevPageRanks, epsilon));

        return pageRanks;
    }

    private static boolean converged(double[] pageRanks, double[] prevPageRanks, double epsilon) {
        for (int i = 0; i < pageRanks.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(pageRanks[i] - prevPageRanks[i]) > epsilon) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the example above, we create a simplified implementation of the PageRank algorithm. The algorithm's complexity depends on the number of iterations required for convergence, which is generally low. As a result, the algorithm can scale to handle large datasets.

**Cryptography**

Cryptography plays a vital role in ensuring the security and privacy of data. Modern cryptographic systems rely on the computational complexity of specific problems, such as factoring large prime numbers or solving discrete logarithms.

One widely used cryptographic algorithm is the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. The security of the RSA algorithm depends on the hardness of this problem.

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class RSAExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        BigInteger p = BigInteger.probablePrime(1024, random);
        BigInteger q = BigInteger.probablePrime(1024, random);

        BigInteger n = p.multiply(q);
        BigInteger phi = p.subtract(BigInteger.ONE).multiply(q.subtract(BigInteger.ONE));
        BigInteger e = BigInteger.valueOf(65537);
        BigInteger d = e.modInverse(phi);

        BigInteger plaintext = new BigInteger("123456789");
        BigInteger ciphertext = plaintext.modPow(e, n);
        BigInteger decryptedText = ciphertext.modPow(d, n);

        System.out.println("Plaintext: " + plaintext);
        System.out.println("Ciphertext: " + ciphertext);
        System.out.println("Decrypted text: " + decryptedText);
    }
}
```
In the example above, we demonstrate a simplified version of the RSA algorithm. We generate two large prime numbers p and q and compute their product n. The public key is the pair (e, n), and the private key is the pair (d, n). We encrypt and decrypt a sample plaintext value using modular exponentiation.

The security of the RSA algorithm depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. As the size of the key increases, the algorithm's complexity increases exponentially, making it more challenging for adversaries to break the encryption.

In summary, understanding the complexity of algorithms used in search engines and cryptography is crucial for ensuring performance, security, and scalability. The examples provided illustrate the importance of selecting appropriate algorithms and understanding their complexity to meet the requirements of real-world applications.
