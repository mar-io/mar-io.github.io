### 1.1.2 Efficient Resource Utilization

Efficient resource utilization refers to the effective management of computational resources, such as CPU and memory, when executing a software application. By using appropriate data structures and algorithms, developers can minimize resource usage and improve the performance of their applications.

Here's a simple example in Java, demonstrating the difference between an efficient and inefficient code snippet for reversing a string.

**Inefficient code:**

```java
public class InefficientReverse {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "Hello, World!";
        String reversed = "";

        for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversed += input.charAt(i);
        }

        System.out.println("Reversed: " + reversed);
    }
}
```

In this inefficient example, we're using string concatenation to reverse the input string. This approach creates a new string object for each iteration, which consumes more memory and has poor performance.

**Efficient code:**

```java
public class EfficientReverse {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "Hello, World!";
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(input.length());

        for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversed.append(input.charAt(i));
        }

        System.out.println("Reversed: " + reversed.toString());
    }
}
```

In the efficient example, we're using a `StringBuilder` to reverse the input string. This approach avoids creating a new string object for each iteration, which results in better memory usage and improved performance.
